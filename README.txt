aHUD | Fork of 7HUD


Notes:

aHUD v3 use the 4.01 version of 7HUD.

The same options for 7HUD applies here too.


How to install:

Download the archive (.zip/.rar), there should be a folder named "aHUD_"; Extract that folder to:
*steaminstallation*/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom

To uninstall, just delete the "aHUD_" folder in tf/custom

The orignal HUD goes to Sevin7, i've done only some modifications.
